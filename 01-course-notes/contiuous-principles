📄 Continuous Principles – DevOps Summary
This module explores how DevOps enables seamless, automated, and reliable software delivery through structured pipelines and continuous feedback loops.

🔁 DevOps Pipelines
Automated workflows for build, test, deploy, and monitoring. Key components include:

Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Deployment

Continuous Testing, Monitoring, Feedback, and Operations

⚙️ Pipeline Automation
Automation spans development, testing, production, and monitoring. Used in:

Infrastructure provisioning

Application deployment

Configuration management (e.g., GitOps workflows)

🚀 Operational Efficiency with CI/CD
CI/CD creates repeatable, reliable workflows

Automated triggers: code check-in, compilation, testing

Secure handling of secrets via vaults

Pipelines often follow stages: Source → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor

🧪 Testing & Validation
Fully automated unit, regression, integration, and acceptance testing

CI = Build + Test

CD = Manual approvals; CDP = Fully automated

Validation ensures quality and reduces risk using analyzers & health markers

📡 Monitoring & Continuous Feedback
Final pipeline stage

Covers infrastructure, application, and network

Use tools like Prometheus, Nagios, Sensu Go

Alerts and transparency are key

📈 Continuous Improvement
A culture powered by team retrospectives

Improvements span process (led by PO/Scrum Master) and technical areas

📦 Containers in DevOps
Encapsulate code, dependencies, and runtime

Enable portability, isolation, and lightweight deployment

Tools: Docker, Kubernetes

Challenges: concurrent dev, security, config management

🧪 Containerization in CI/CD
Automate builds, clone production, bundle artifacts

Easier scaling, feedback, and deployment

🛡️ Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
Focus on system reliability, resiliency, and visibility

Complements DevOps; SRE ensures ops stability & customer satisfaction
