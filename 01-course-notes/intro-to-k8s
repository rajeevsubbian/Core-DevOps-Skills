Kubernetes Overview
📌 Introduction
In modern infrastructure, scaling and automation are critical. Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

⚙️ Kubernetes Foundation
Runs applications across a cluster of machines.

Master node manages the cluster; worker nodes run containerized workloads.

Core components:

API Server – communication hub (used by kubectl)

Scheduler – assigns workloads

Controller Manager – ensures desired state

Kubelet – manages node containers

Kube-proxy – networking

etcd – key-value store for cluster state

🧩 Key Concepts
Cluster – group of nodes.

Pod – smallest deployable unit (1+ containers).

Volume / Persistent Volume – persistent data storage.

Manifests – declarative definitions of desired state.

Tools: kubectl, Minikube, Helm, Terraform, EKS, Rancher, Loft.

🔄 Workflow
Application packaged in Docker.

Deploy to K8s via manifests.

K8s schedules, runs, and maintains desired state automatically.

Scale up/down and self-heal as needed.

🔐 Security
Restrict API and kubelet access.

Secure etcd and isolate nodes.

Enable audit logging.

Use identity providers (GitHub, Google).

Tools like Aqua enhance security posture.

🚀 Use Cases
CI/CD pipelines

Serverless architectures

IoT deployments

High-performance computing (HPC)

Machine learning workloads

Self-healing services

Lift-and-shift application migration

🆚 Kubernetes vs Docker
Docker – container runtime, image building, Swarm orchestration.

Kubernetes – container orchestration, scaling, automation, and extensibility.
