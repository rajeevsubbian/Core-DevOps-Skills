Introduction to Jenkins for DevOps
Overview
Jenkins is a widely used open-source CI/CD tool that automates building, testing, and deployment. It supports multiple plugins, integrates with services like EKS and ECS, and works across diverse environments without licensing costs.

Continuous Integration (CI)
Automates code integration from multiple developers.

Runs tests on each commit, identifies issues early, and speeds up fixes.

Server-based with easy setup and broad plugin support.

Role in DevOps
Central to development, testing, and deployment pipelines.

Architecture: Masterâ€“Slave model for distributed builds.

Automates code integration and delivery for faster releases.

Jenkins & CI/CD
Distributed via WAR files, installers, Docker images, Homebrew, or source code.

Supports six job types and plugin categories (UI, build mgmt, SCM, etc.).

Pipelines: Created via Jenkinsfile, Web UI, or scripts (Declarative & Scripted).

Docker Integration
Jenkins can run inside Docker or orchestrate Docker-based builds.

Requires Java and supported OS (Linux/Windows) plus browser access.

Ansible Automation
Jenkins can trigger Ansible to provision and deploy applications to production.

AWS Integration
Works with Amazon VPC, EC2, ECS, and CodeBuild.

Involves creating key pairs, security groups, and configuring Jenkins on a VM.

Git Integration
Connect GitHub to Jenkins via SSH keys for source code pulls and build triggers.

Email Notifications
Notifies teams of pre- and post-deployment issues.

Configurable triggers, recipients, and content via the Email Extension Plugin.

Supports tokens, custom subjects, attachments, and pipeline integration.

Maven Integration
Automates builds, dependency management, and documentation generation.

Uses POM.xml to define builds and integrates seamlessly with Jenkins.

Job Building in Jenkins
Core build process: Freestyle or Maven projects.

Jobs can run manually or automatically (GitHub hooks, SCM polling, remote triggers, post-build triggers).
