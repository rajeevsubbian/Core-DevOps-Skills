## ðŸŽ¯ Goals for Today

- Finish "Ansible for DevOps:Ansible Basics"

## âœ… What I Did

- Started Learning Ansible Basics

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Ansible overview - IT automation engine, Multi tier deployment, No agents, No custom security infra, Ansible modules -> executes --> removes after execution. ini file, plain text inventory. FQDN. Modules, plugins, python APIs
- Ansible Anatomy - Ansible automation platform(AAP), collections (using galaxy), Control node. Handlers, Inventory, Managed nodes, Modules, Playbooks -> Plays, plugins, Roles, tasks. Playbook flags -i inventory file, -u ssh, -k ssh authenticaiton, -f fork, -T timeout, -t only task marked with targ, -m load local modules
- Automation and integration - reduce complexity, avoid repetition, commit fewer mistakes, focus on innovation, increase productivity, Enhance collaboration, Improve accountability. Ansible helps in improving knowledge, control and delegation. Integration with multiple OS, storage, virtualisation. It helps integration.
- Network Automation - AAP, collections, control node, Inventory, managed nodes. Modules -> Specific task, playbook contains plays, plugins. Collections organised by n/w platform, privilege escalation. Infrastructure awareness.
- Ansible Engine - Its Automation solution. applicaiton release automation. production, full support, maintenance support. Ansible tower - web based UI.
- Ansible Tower - Automation dashboard, role based access control(RBAC), delegation and self-service, Automation workflows, REST API. Ansible helps manage inventory.
- Commands and tools for ansible - ansible doc, ansible command line, ansible-galaxy, ansible-pull, Ansible adhoc command, adhoc commands - services mgmt, user and group mgmt, Additional tools -> Editors, development tools, playbook validation, other
- patterns, hosts and groups - Pattern depend on inventory and it must match the syntax, it uses host file and group_vars directory, NPT server.
- Ansible orchestration - Execution of workflow is orchestration. orchestration is about combining different elements. Define infrastructure, orchestrate openstack, orechestrate orchestrators, command blaster, configuraiton trigger, config ordering
- Ansible Vault - encrypt variables and files, need script to access, ansible-vault create my_file.yml (it will give a password, makesure you don't lose it). Using vault id is another standard.
- YAML Playbooks - playbook is way of implementing repeatable task.
- Ansible usecases - Application deployment, orchestration, continuos delivery, network automation,
