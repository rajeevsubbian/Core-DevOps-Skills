## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Understand about container, docker and kubernets
- Classic server computing - Application can be developer or can be purchased, classic server computing needs physical server, speed and capacity. Business maintain cost -> server purchase and costly. Captial expenses and recurring expenses, Cost of inefficient usage. We might waste lot of money. Only provision what we need.
- Challenges of classic server deployment - capital expenses, recurring costs, licenses, maintenance. Buying new server and same set of cost again. server capacity, dependencies, resource constraints.
- Virtual computing - Mimic physical computers, virtual appliances, Host - Guest, Memory, CPU, operating system. Two types of VM - process VM's, system VM's. Multiple VM's , Isolation, Scaling. hypervisor - isolate vm's .. Type 1 - runs bare metal and no other operating system, directly and type 2 - run inside another operating system
- Pros and cons - pro -> cost, reliability, scaling (virtual environment takes minutes to scale), productivity, improved efficiency, environmental friendly, security (can be used to role back), flexibility cons -> Infrastructure design, workloads, VM sprawl (can occur gradually), Licensing, security can be challenge as well, data security as same vm is accessed by diffent people, network configuration, resource distribution, performance monitoirng, backward compatability.
- Container Computing - VM virtualises entire computer whereas container virtualises the software above them. containers are light weight, they don't use hyperviser. Containers -> Virtualises os software. Advantatge -> Overhead, cost goes down, lower foot print. Rapidly build and deployed in minutes. Can be easily maintained.
- Pros and Cons of containers - pros and cons -> Platform independence. We create application, speed with which we deliver. efficiency , productivity, resource sharing, Easy to operate, easily reproduced. Challenge - Data management, security, sillsets, Disaster recovery. complexity, managability, evolving technology evolution. planning, data protection, needs on org cultural, shifts.
- Docker vs Kubernetes - Docker swarm is the orchestration tool, containers and suite of tools, Docker build, Docker desktop. Common b/w Kubernetes and Docker - Orchestration (flexible and scaling)
- Major containers - Open container initiative (OCI). interface to docker via CLI. Adv of using container standards -> Flexibility, reliability, better understanding. DOcker alternate - Podman, Buildah, Kaniko
- Summary - Bare metal solution computing and server challenges, virtual and container computing and challenges, Docker and Kubernetes and compared major containers.
