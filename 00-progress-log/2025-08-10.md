## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Introduction - Key concepts
- Chef Platform - Chef Infra. Components - Chef Infra (platform) it can convert infrastructure to code. chef workstation, cookbook authoring, cookstyle, chespec, chef inspec, test kitchen. After development code can be uploaded to chef Infra server. chef habitat - offers application automation. chef inspec - a testing framework, node is any machine under management by chef.
- Chef use cases - patch management, audit, payment card industry data. GDPR requirement. among other cases chef can be used for application deployment, legacy app modernaisation etc. helps with continous delivery, standard and non standard delivery. it helps with more security so devsecops. chef can integrate with docker, integrate with azure, virtual machine, kubernetes
- Prerequisites for Chef - Chef Infra server, 64 bit CPU mininum is needed. 4 CPU cores, 8GB+ Ram, 5 GB disk space in opt, 10GB disk space in var. For high availability atleast 3 server. once the required hardwares are done then Hostnames, FQDNs, NTP, Mail Relay, Cron, Git should be installed. Apache Qpid should be disable and required users, firewall and port should be configured. Access to browser, communication b/w chef client and server. Chef Infra client and chef work station. Chef uses Ruby underneath.
- Ruby for chef - :nothing - this does nothing. code, creates, cwd, environment, flags, group, ignore_failure, notifies (run other resource), returns, subscribes, timeout, user (name or id to change), unmask .. All resource share common functionality - Acrions, propertiies, conditional executions, Nofitifications, relative paths. compile time, ignore failure, retries, retry delay, sensitive. Guard property - Detwermine whether to continue execution or not. ruby_block
- chef automate - provides operation oversight. Infrastructure automation, applicaiton automation, security automation. Dashboard which will have various metrics. Key features. collect data from chef server and client for aggregation and analysis tools, compliance history and reporting. Capabilities - colaborate. It has continuous integration and continuous delivery. Powered by 3 automation engines - chef, habitat, Inspec. components category - core applications, authentication authorization and administration, management and back-end services, optional components
- chef Habitat - Open source solution. 3 capabilities - Defines, packages, delivers. standardiesed devlopment model across. Scales agile adoption. chef habitat studio - defines builds and installations, isolates dpendencies (container has necessary framework installed), utilize premade plan. .HART can be exported and executed (Habitat application artifact file). chef habitat builder - storage, search, API.Delivery - habitat supervisory - to automation applicaiton management. create templates for configuration. plans - compile script, services.
- chef infra - Infrasturcture deployment and configuraiton automatically. it has git so version control present. Eliminates drift. Manage all major platform like windows, linux arm and mac. Uses declerative language. components - chef workstation, cookbooks, Ruby, Nodes, Chef client, Chef server, chef supermarket (community for preexisting cook books). Server - hub for all infrastructure - cookbooks, policies, metadata. client is infrastructure as code tool
- Chef InSpec - focus on compliance is one of the best feature. Describes security and compliance rules. requirement turn into automated test. Security automation, compliance automation, compliance auditing. Inspec is platform agnostic. Inspec mainly for compliance. surrounding infrastructure, provisioning
- chef security, compliance and auditing - CSPM solutions (cloud security posture management). cloud security tool. Features - policy as code, IaC template scanning, continous compliance auditing, Audit and remediation, baselines, visibility and control. trusted content access, compliance baseline definitions, deviation detections, policy driven remediation, reporting. Advantage - continous compliance, streamlined audits. used to resolve compliance issue and security audits
- Infrastructure management - prewritten code block how the cloud services to be deployed. download cookbook from community to start with from github. advantage - consistency, visibility, repeatability, safe to perform changes, easy scalability, runs anywhere, actionable insights. by implementing you can get some valuable results (natural TDD). Position to extend to AIOPS.
- Applicaiton delivery solution - on-site, cloud, hybrid. defining, deploying and packaging. manage complexity, ebrace agile practices, Focus on existing assets. helps devops team to do what they need to do automatically. avoid tech debt, modernize processes. Advantage - Rapid deployment, greater productiviy, lower overhead, Push you into more modern solutions. Chef has cloud migration system to migrate from onperm to cloud.
- chef vs ansible - Ansible - simplest opensource cnofiguration management tool, application deployment, software provisioning. both are similar. Ansible - yaml chef - ruby. Ansible is more reasonably priced. Ansible uses push method and chef uses pull method for configuration. Ansible is comparitively easy and very small configuration. chef provides lot of functionality. chef is extendable. Ansible can't handle complex task. chef disadv - high cost, programming expertise, learning curve. use chef for security and compliance automation solutions for ansible deployments. both of them can be used to reduce vulnerabilities.
