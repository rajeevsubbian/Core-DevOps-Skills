## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Devops pipelines - Automated workflows. Used for Build, test and deploy. First component of pipeline is continuous integration and second section is continuous delivery, third component is continous deployment. Another component is continous feedback. Continuous testing - Ability to automatically validate before releasing to prod and in some case after release. Continous Monitoring, Continuous operations.
- Devops Pipeline Automation - Development, Testing, Production, Monitoring. Common use case is in Infrastructure provisioning, Application deployment and configuration management. Gitops - workflow manager.
- Operational Efficiency with CI/CD - Pipeline divided into stages. CI/CD gives reliable and repetable process. Compiling and Testing. Product artifacts - Packaged software, Automated deployment. Stages Automated invocation - pipeline best run when triggered automatically, Code checkout, Code compilation. Package should give you every detail for the software. Pipeline credentials should always be protected in vaults or secrets.
- Source Stage - Deals with actual source code. When code gets triggered into main normally pipeline gets triggered, this can be customised based on project need. polling - condition checked, webhook - when webhook is trigerred pipeline gets executed. Ideally one pipeline per repository.
