- Finish "Core DevOps Skills: Case Studies in Devops"

## ✅ What I Did

- Completed case studies
- Started with - "Working with containers"

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Journeys by various companies in devops
- Rapid development, rapid deployment, smaller feedback loops, rapid disaster recovery. Devops is organizational phylosophy. CI/CD tool, version control tools, build tools, servers, tests. Maturity model - evolutionary process -> continuous improvement. In devops start small, embrace failure, acknowledge its an experiment, Establish visibility. Get organization buy-in, be patient, celebrate victories.
- Hospitality companies devops journey - fashion, retail, hospital, restaurant. Challenge - IT infrastructure, rapid increase of clients, s/w required frequest updates. IT infrastructure management was also a problem. continous monitoring.
- Capital ones Devops Journey - challenges -> Move from waterfall to Agile, Cloud first policy, Foster integration. Fail-fast approach, consistency, cloud adoption, central tooling, Approach --> Design for scaling, Automation, pick somewhere to begin. Results -> Reduced time to build, Devops teams have what they need, More collaborative culture. Engages other employees, Quality teams
- IG Groups Devops Journey - Problem -> Legacy project, Multiple responsibilities for the people Challenge -> Maintain what they had, Legacy software. Flaws -> Maintenance cost significant, No auditing on sent messages, downtime during deployment even when planned. Good way of implementing devops is buy in from both management and the team. Team should take pride in their work.
- Just Eat's Devops journey - Challenge - heavy volumen, 1500 new instances, 500 releases per week, 1.5 TB micro service logs. Solution -> Create Devops team starting with SRE (monitor the system and baseline what is needed), adding tooling. Implemented Agile methodology. With AI just eats was able to detect pattern automatically.
- UK Govt Devops - HMRC has 45 million customers. Started implementing Devops in 2013. Struggled to handle the load. Needs -> Scalability, Connectivity, Tools needed. Take away -> Continous improvement, improved collaboration, Shared ways to work
- Daily telegraph's Devops - Needs -> Competetive environment, engage customers Challenges -> Digital disruption in 2009, Awkward change process, Poor communication (as it is very old organisation), produc backlog (FIFO did not work). THree-stage Approach -> Get content out, Additional engineers, Collaboration. Result -> Significant Audience insights, Faster analytics collection, Relocate legacy system to containers in cloud.
- U.S govt - U.S patent and trademark office, U.S citizenship and immigraiton services (both implemnted dev). National park service. National science foundation. In all the organisation devops was implemented.
- Etsy's Devops Journey - Started with 35 employees, Startup culture, No ability to scale. Needs -> Culture shift, Collaboration, Real time synchronization Challenges -> Frequent file changes, Inconsistent deployment models, Low deployment confidence, more deployment time, little flexibility, high pressure env. Results -> Started off small, Began this deployment with two weeks iteration. How they did -> Adapt "code as craft" culture. Continuous delivery. Key Element -> Automated testing, continuous monitoring, data recording, communication.
- Netflix's Devops journey - Challenge -> Massive amounts of traffic, Major database corruption. Solutions -> Move away from vertical scaling (cloud) How they did -> build using containers, Build for failure, Deveop a devops culture. result -> NoSQL database instead of relational DB, Loosely coupled teams, empowered teams, centralized releases, continous delivery
- Summary - How devops integrated into different companies

---

- Understand about container, docker and kubernets
- Classic server computing - Application can be developer or can be purchased, classic server computing needs physical server, speed and capacity. Business maintain cost -> server purchase and costly. Captial expenses and recurring expenses, Cost of inefficient usage. We might waste lot of money. Only provision what we need.
